          Screen Replacement Within First Year DYNAMIC ISLAND COMES TO IPHONE 15
          — Dynamic Island bubbles up alerts and Live Activities — so you don't
          miss them while you're doing something else. You can see who's
          calling, track your next ride, check your flight status, and so much
          more. INNOVATIVE DESIGN — iPhone 15 features a durable color-infused
          glass and aluminum design. It's splash, water, and dust resistant. The
          Ceramic Shield front is tougher than any smartphone glass. And the
          6.1" Super Retina XDR display is up to 2x brighter in the sun compared
          to iPhone 14. 48MP MAIN CAMERA WITH 2X TELEPHOTO — The 48MP Main
          camera shoots in super-high resolution. So it's easier than ever to
          take standout photos with amazing detail. The 2x optical-quality
          Telephoto lets you frame the perfect close-up. NEXT-GENERATION
          PORTRAITS — Capture portraits with dramatically more detail and color.
          Just tap to shift the focus between subjects — even after you take the
          shot. POWERHOUSE A16 BIONIC CHIP — The superfast chip powers advanced
          features like computational photography, fluid Dynamic Island
          transitions, and Voice Isolation for phone calls. And A16 Bionic is
          incredibly efficient to help deliver great all-day battery life.
